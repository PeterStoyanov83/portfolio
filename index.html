            <p>
                Hello everyone,<br>
                my name is Peter Stoyanov, and I am thrilled to have the opportunity to share my story
                with you.
                Throughout my life, I have embarked on various careers and pursued diverse passions, each contributing
                to my
                personal growth and shaping me into the versatile individual I am today. Join me as I take you through
                my
                strengths, personal achievements, and unwavering commitment to learning.
            </p>
            <h3>Strengths</h3>
            <p>
                From a young age, computers have been my interest, and my immersion in the vast world of IT allows me to
                excel
                in learning new technologies, particularly Python. Moreover, my background as an avid luthier and sushi
                chef
                brings a unique set of experiences and knowledge that enables me to provide fresh perspectives and adapt
                quickly
                to new situations.
            </p>
            <h3>Personal Achievements</h3>
            <p>
                My journey has taken me through various careers, and while they may seem different, they all share a
                common
                thread: people. As a clown performer, I have had the opportunity to lead workshops and trainings,
                connecting
                with individuals from all walks of life and professions. This international experience has taught me
                invaluable
                lessons in adaptability and resilience, as I have successfully built lives in multiple locations.
                Additionally,
                my mastery of the sushi craft has opened doors to exciting opportunities, including invitations to
                forums,
                events, and private parties. The satisfaction of providing unforgettable culinary experiences and
                leading
                workshops, projects, and restaurant trainings has fueled my drive for continuous learning and personal
                growth.
            </p>
            <h3>Learning</h3>
            <p>
                Currently, I am enrolled in an online full-stack Python Developer course, which I began in July 2022. I
                am proud to have completed the "Advanced" module and passed the associated exams, showcasing my
                commitment to
                excellence. Currently, I am immersing myself in the OOP modules, with an anticipated
                completion date in August. I stay abreast of the latest developments in
                AI tools and applications, ensuring I remain at the forefront of technological advancements. In the near
                future, I am excited to tackle the challenge of learning the German language.
            </p>

            <h3>The Game of Pong</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
            <strong>Description:</strong><br>
            The Pong game you shared is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python and the Turtle
            graphics library.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Libraries Used:</strong> <br>
            <strong>Turtle:</strong><br> The Turtle library is a built-in Python library that provides a simple way to
            create graphics and animations. It is used in this game to create the game window, paddles, ball, and handle
            the game's animation and movement.<br><br>
            <strong>OS:</strong> <br>The OS library is used to manage the sounds in the game.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Techniques Employed:</strong><br><br>
            <strong>Game Loop:</strong><br>
            The main game loop is a while loop that continuously updates the game state and
            handles user input. It ensures that the game runs smoothly by updating the positions of the paddles and
            ball, detecting collisions, and updating the scores.<br><br>
            <strong>Keyboard Input:</strong><br>
            The game captures keyboard input using the wn.onkeypress() function from
            the Turtle library.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Collision Detection:</strong><br>
            The game checks for collisions between the ball and the paddles, as well as the ball and the top/bottom
            boundaries of the game window. This allows the ball to bounce off the paddles and walls.<br><br>
            <strong>Score Tracking:</strong><br>
            The game keeps track of the score for each player (Player A and Player B)
            using the score_a and score_b variables. The scores are displayed on the screen using the Turtle library's
            pen object.<br><br>
            <strong>Sound Effects:</strong> The game incorporates sound effects using the os.system() function to play
            audio files when certain events occur, such as the ball hitting the paddles, scoring points, or the game
            ending.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            To play the game, follow these steps:<br><br>
        <ol>
            <li>Install PyCharm: PyCharm is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Python. You can download and
                install PyCharm from the official website <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">here</a>. Choose
                the appropriate version for your operating system and follow the installation instructions.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Install Python: Python is the programming language used to run the game. You can download Python from
                the official Python website <a href="https://www.python.org/">here</a>. Choose the latest stable version
                for your operating system and follow the installation instructions.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Install the required libraries: The game requires the Turtle library, which is a built-in library in
                Python. There is no need to install it separately.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Open the game in PyCharm: Once you have PyCharm and Python installed, open PyCharm and create a new
                Python project. Copy the code for the Pong game into a new Python file in your project.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Run the game: In PyCharm, click the Run button or press the designated hotkey to run the game. The game
                window should open, and you can start playing by using the keyboard controls specified in the code.
            </li>
        </ol>

            <h3>Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
            <strong>Description:</strong><br>
            The Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock game is an expanded version of the classic Rock Paper Scissors
            game, adding two additional options: Lizard and Spock. This game allows you to compete against the
            computer by choosing one of the available moves and seeing who wins based on the rules of the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Libraries Used:</strong><br>
            <strong>termcolor:</strong> The termcolor library is used to add colored output to the terminal. It
            provides functions like `colored()` and `cprint()` to print text in different colors. It is used in this
            game to enhance the visual display of the game results.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Techniques Employed:</strong><br>
            <strong>Random Number Generation:</strong> The `random` module is used to generate a random number
            between 1 and 5, representing the computer's move. This ensures a random selection of moves for the
            computer.<br><br>
            <strong>Dictionary Lookup:</strong> A dictionary is used to map the generated random number to the
            corresponding move (Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock). This lookup technique allows for efficient and
            concise retrieval of the computer's move.<br><br>
            <strong>Conditional Statements:</strong> The game uses conditional statements (if-elif-else) to determine
            the
            outcome of each round based on the chosen moves. It compares the player's move and the computer's move to
            determine the winner or if it's a draw.<br><br>
            <strong>Score Tracking:</strong> The game keeps track of the player's and computer's points using the
            `PLAYER_POINTS` and `COMPUTER_POINTS` variables. Points are incremented based on the outcome of each
            round.<br><br>
            <strong>User Input:</strong> The game prompts the player to choose a move by entering a command (r, p, s, l,
            o)
            corresponding to Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock. The `input()` function is used to capture the
            user's input.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            To play the game, follow these steps:<br>
            1. Run the Python script in your preferred Python environment.<br>
            2. The game will prompt you to choose a move by entering the corresponding command (r, p, s, l, o).<br>
            3. The computer will randomly select a move.<br>
            4. The game will display the computer's move and determine the winner or if it's a draw.<br>
            5. The player's and computer's points will be updated based on the outcome.<br>
            6. You can choose to play another round by entering 'y' or exit the game by entering 'n'.<br>
