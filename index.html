        Hello, my name is Peter. I started my journey in IT with an online course in Python.<br>
        That was 1 year ago.<br>
        After 15 years of being a sushi chef, I decided that my career in the restaurant industry<br>
        could not be improved. I found my new challenge in IT and a new chapter in my life began.<br>

            <h3>The Game of Pong</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
            Description:<br>
            The Pong game you shared is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python and the Turtle
            graphics library.
        </p>
        <p>
            Libraries Used:<br>
            <strong>Turtle:</strong> The Turtle library is a built-in Python library that provides a simple way to
            create graphics and animations. It is used in this game to create the game window, paddles, ball, and handle
            the game's animation and movement.<br>
            <strong>OS:</strong> The OS library is used to manage the sounds in the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            Techniques Employed:<br>
            <strong>Game Loop:</strong> The main game loop is a while loop that continuously updates the game state and
            handles user input. It ensures that the game runs smoothly by updating the positions of the paddles and
            ball, detecting collisions, and updating the scores.<br>
            <strong>Keyboard Input:</strong> The game captures keyboard input using the wn.onkeypress() function from
            the Turtle library.<br>
            <strong>Collision Detection:</strong> The game checks for collisions between the ball and the paddles, as
            well as the ball and the top/bottom boundaries of the game window. This allows the ball to bounce off the
            paddles and walls.<br>
            <strong>Score Tracking:</strong> The game keeps track of the score for each player (Player A and Player B)
            using the score_a and score_b variables. The scores are displayed on the screen using the Turtle library's
            pen object.<br>
            <strong>Sound Effects:</strong> The game incorporates sound effects using the os.system() function to play
            audio files when certain events occur, such as the ball hitting the paddles, scoring points, or the game
            ending.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            To play the game, follow these steps:<br>
            1. Install PyCharm: PyCharm is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Python. You can download and
            install PyCharm from the official website (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). Choose the appropriate
            version for your operating system and follow the installation instructions.<br>
            2. Install Python: Python is the programming language used to run the game. You can download Python from the
            official Python website (https://www.python.org/). Choose the latest stable version for your operatingsystem
            and follow the installation instructions.<br>
            3. Install the required libraries: The game requires the Turtle library, which is a built-in library in
            Python. There is no need to install it separately.<br>
            4. Open the game in PyCharm: Once you have PyCharm and Python installed, open PyCharm and create a new
            Python project. Copy the code for the Pong game into a new Python file in your project.<br>
            5. Run the game: In PyCharm, click the Run button or press the designated hotkey to run the game. The game
            window should open, and you can start playing by using the keyboard controls specified in the code.

            <h3>Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
            Description:<br>
            The Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock game is an expanded version of the classic Rock Paper Scissors
            game, adding two additional options: Lizard and Spock. This game allows you to compete against the
            computer by choosing one of the available moves and seeing who wins based on the rules of the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            Libraries Used:<br>
            <strong>termcolor:</strong> The termcolor library is used to add colored output to the terminal. It
            provides functions like `colored()` and `cprint()` to print text in different colors. It is used in this
            game to enhance the visual display of the game results.
        </p>
        <p>
            Techniques Employed:<br>
            <strong>Random Number Generation:</strong> The `random` module is used to generate a random number
            between 1 and 5, representing the computer's move. This ensures a random selection of moves for the
            computer.<br>
            <strong>Dictionary Lookup:</strong> A dictionary is used to map the generated random number to the
            corresponding move (Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock). This lookup technique allows for efficient and
            concise retrieval of the computer's move.<br>
            <strong>Conditional Statements:</strong> The game uses conditional statements (if-elif-else) to determine
            the
            outcome of each round based on the chosen moves. It compares the player's move and the computer's move to
            determine the winner or if it's a draw.<br>
            <strong>Score Tracking:</strong> The game keeps track of the player's and computer's points using the
            `PLAYER_POINTS` and `COMPUTER_POINTS` variables. Points are incremented based on the outcome of each
            round.<br>
            <strong>User Input:</strong> The game prompts the player to choose a move by entering a command (r, p, s, l,
            o)
            corresponding to Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock. The `input()` function is used to capture the
            user's input.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            To play the game, follow these steps:<br>
            1. Run the Python script in your preferred Python environment.<br>
            2. The game will prompt you to choose a move by entering the corresponding command (r, p, s, l, o).<br>
            3. The computer will randomly select a move.<br>
            4. The game will display the computer's move and determine the winner or if it's a draw.<br>
            5. The player's and computer's points will be updated based on the outcome.<br>
            6. You can choose to play another round by entering 'y' or exit the game by entering 'n'.<br>

        </div>
        <p>
            The Calculator Machine is a simple command-line calculator program that allows users to perform basic
            arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It was created by Peter
            Stoyanov and inspired by the SoftUni Fundamentals course taught by lecturer M. Zahariev.

            <li>Run the Python script in your preferred Python environment.</li>
            <li>Choose one of the available options:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>1 - Addition</li>
                <li>2 - Subtraction</li>
                <li>3 - Multiplication</li>
                <li>4 - Division</li>
                <li>5 - Exit</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Enter the first number.</li>
            <li>Enter the second number.</li>
            <li>The program will perform the selected operation and display the result.</li>
            <li>Repeat the process or choose option 5 to exit the program.</li>
        </ol>
